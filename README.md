Tested to work in Russia, RTK ISP. 
Configurations are collected from other similar github repositories, you can find the best collection of them in [NiREvils](https://github.com/NiREvil/vless?tab=readme-ov-file#xray) repository. 
80% are guaranteed to work on the first day after an update.

Config checking algorhythm:
- run a.py
- check with [nekoray](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/nekoray) for validity

Subscriptions
- a - all valid cfg from github
- b - manually chosen VLESS with Reality/XTLS configurations [Recommended]
- c - subscription for testing

Scripts
- a.py - searches for the lines that have **thing** in links and adds them to **path**. Also does some cleaning, sorting and numbering for better experience.
- b.py - adds country flags to configs by checking their IP's through a free API. [Slow]
